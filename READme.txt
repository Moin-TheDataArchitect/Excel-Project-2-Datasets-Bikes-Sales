Hey Everyone, I have created my first excel dashboard which is bike sales analysis this report looks closely at bike sales data to find out some important things, like how much money people spend on average when they buy a bike, how far they usually travel to get to work, how old they are, and where they live. We used pivot tables to make it easier to understand the data and figure out what it means.

Data Description:
The bike sales dataset encompasses various columns including ID, Marital Status, Gender, Income, Children, Education, Occupation, Home Owner, Cars, Commute Distance, Region, and Age. These dimensions provide a rich source of information for understanding customer behavior and sales patterns.

To achieve the goal of this project, I have completed several tasks.

âœ… Firstly, Understanding the provided dataset.

âœ… Then I performed data cleaning to remove any duplicates, spaces, and special characters, find and replace, and formatting.

âœ… Created custom columns (Age Brackets) to extract additional information from the dataset.

âœ… Created Pivot tables, Charts, and Graphs ðŸ“Š to summarise the data and visually get quick information and make it easier to understand.

âœ… Finally, I built a dashboard in Excel with slicers, which allows users to interact with the data and view it in different ways.

 Key insights :

âž¡ Pivot Table Analysis:
1. Average Income per Purchase:
This table shows how much money, on average, people who bought bikes make. It helps us understand the different groups of customers and how much they can spend.
2. Customers per Commute Distance:
This table groups customers based on how far they travel to work. It helps us see where our customers are coming from and plan our marketing better.
3. Customers per Age Bracket:
This table divides customers into different age groups. It helps us know the ages of our customers so we can make products and marketing that suit them.
4. Customers per Region:
This table tells us how many customers we have in each area. It helps us see where our bikes are selling well and where we might need to focus more on selling.

âž¡ Conclusion:
Looking at all this information, we can see a clearer picture of who our customers are and how they behave. This helps us make better decisions about how to sell bikes and where to focus our efforts. By understanding our customers' income, age, location, and how far they travel, we can make sure our products and marketing messages are right for them.
